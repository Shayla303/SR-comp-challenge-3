# Static-Comp-Challenge-3
This comp is a replica of an HR dashboard containing graphs and charts, icons and navigation bars containing a great deal of hopeful information for a user. I was able to get a few media queries in this iteration, however lost a lot of my content integrity at smaller sizes and missed the opportunity to include ARIA tags.This comp was also very style heavy with the usage of icons and several css lines. I do appreciate the exercise also in using shortcuts and will implement the usage of idiomatic css going forward.
Below is an example of the original comp
